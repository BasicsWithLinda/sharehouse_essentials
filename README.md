# Sharehouse Manager

A simple python program which can help manage what sucks the most about living in a sharehouse - managing who owes what, and the actual house itself. 
Stores all the data for you so that it's all centralised.
You do not need to download anything, but be wary of the poor user interface (the terminal)...

## Features
- **Debt Management**: Track who owes how much to who, including the date of the debt, amount, and over what item.
- **Household Needs**: Easily view items needed for the sharehouse, such as the budget, the item, and how long it has been since you've needed it.
- **Data Visualisation**: See people's debts in a bar graph so you can easily compare, and view resolved and unresolved household items in a table.
